# Linear-Regression-Pandas-Matplot-Seaborn---Kaggle-Email-Spam-vs.-Ham
Using Linear Regression, Pandas, Matplot and Seaborn to create and filter spam emails.

This project uses linear regression, pandas, matplot and seaborn to classify and visualize an email classification model. The project also does some analysis into precision and recall metrics, more specifically it contains a percision-recall curve to gain insight into model classification performance. 

The jupyter notebook contained in the repository shows my analysis and vizulizations. It is also sectioned into different parts of the analysis. 
Mainly a data wrangling and EDA section, then modeling and graphing section. 

The ambition of the project is to "test-drive" linear regression and excerise data cleaning and preparation skills. 

This completed project, in the future, can be improved with a neural network classification model. Ensemble methods could also be used on this project to achieve 
higher classfication accuracy and precision.
